# markdown-prefilter-metadata

Extract "native" metadata from markdown files.

At the moment this is just a "proof of concept":  
I personally prefer the idea of native markdown metadata 
over all the "front matter" stuff done in yml, toml and whaterverml...

Going production ready (>=1.0.0) is planned for August 2015.
